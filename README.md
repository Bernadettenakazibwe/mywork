In Python, the def keyword is used to define a function, while the if keyword is used for conditional statements. Here is how to use them:

Defining a Function with def:

To define a function in Python, you can use the def keyword followed by the name of the function and the parameters it takes in parentheses. Then, the function block should be indented:



def my_function(param1, param2):
    # function block
    result = param1 + param2
    return result
In this example, we define a function called my_function that takes two parameters and returns their sum.

** Using if for Conditional Statements: **

The if statement is used to execute a block of code if a certain condition is met. Here is an example:

bash
Copy code
x = 10
if x > 5:
    print("x is greater than 5")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 5")
    
In this example, we use the if keyword to check if x is greater than 5. If the condition is true, then the code inside the if block will be executed; otherwise, the code inside the else block will be executed.

**Combining def and if:**

You can use the if statement inside a function to control the flow of execution based on a condition. Here is an example:


def is_even(num):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False
        
In this example, we define a function called is_even that takes a parameter num. The function checks if num is even by using the modulo operator % and the number 2. If the condition is true, then the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

I hope this helps you understand how to use def and if in Python!
